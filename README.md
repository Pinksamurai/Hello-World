# Hello-World

My name is Pinksamurai Fairlady. I was born in May 2009 in Secondlife. I fell in love with Virtual Worlds the from the minute I rezed in Secondlife on the International School sim mainly because of how connected I felt to the world when I was there but also for the amazing creativity and freedom to learn it encourages, which is also translated into so much beautiy.

This is my first Github respository. I'm using it to learn how to use Github well but I also hope to use it for ideas that I'd like to work on.
